<h1>1) What is the difference between var, let, and const?</h1>
<quote>
  <h3>var:</h3> Its an old type of variable declaration method. It supports all browsers like old ones and the new ones altogether. var is not block scoped as a result it is function scoped. Also var has the ability to be hoisted. Var has some faultness and errors which it himself cant handle smoothly.
  <br>
  <h3>let:</h3>  Let was first introduced in 2015 (ES6) included. Let is not supportive for old browsers but it can easily handle new browsers. Let is block scoped but not function scoped also it can be hoisted as like var. As var has some issue while handling erros, let came as a blessing to overcome those errors and handled them smoothly.
   <br>
  <h3>const:</h3>  Const was first introduced in 2015 (ES6) included. Const is like constant means its value cant be changable so if its once intialized then done it cant be reintialized in the same scope like let.

<h1>2) What is the difference between map(), forEach(), and filter()?</h1>
<h3>map()</h3>
Use map when want to transform each item in an array and get a new array.
It doesn’t change the original array; it creates a new one.
<br>
<h3>forEach()</h3>
Use forEach when just want to do something with each item, like print it or add to a total.
It doesn’t return a new array.
<br>
<h3>filter()</h3>
Use filter when want to keep only some items from an array based on a condition.
It returns a new array with only the items that pass the test.
<h1>3) What are arrow functions in ES6?</h1>
<h3>Arrow functions</h3>
Arrow functions are a new, shorter way to write functions in JavaScript (introduced in ES6). They are also called "fat arrow" functions because they use the => syntax. Arrow functions make code cleaner and automatically bind <code>this</code> to the surrounding context.
<h1>4) How does destructuring assignment work in ES6?</h1>
<h3>Destructuring assignment</h3>
Destructuring assignment is a convenient way in ES6 to extract values from arrays or properties from objects and assign them to variables in a single line. It makes the code cleaner and easier to read.
<h1>5) Explain template literals in ES6. How are they different from string concatenation?</h1>
<h3>Template literals</h3>
Template literals are a new way to work with strings in ES6. They use backticks `` instead of quotes and allow embedding variables or expressions directly inside the string using ${}. This makes string creation much cleaner compared to traditional string concatenation.
