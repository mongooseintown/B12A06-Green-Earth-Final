<h1>1) What is the difference between var, let, and const?</h1>
<quote>
  <h3>var:</h3> Its an old type of variable declaration method. It supports all browsers like old ones and the new ones altogether. var is not block scoped as a result it is function scoped. Also var has the ability to be hoisted. Var has some faultness and errors which it himself cant handle smoothly.
  <br>
  <h3>let:</h3>  Let was first introduced in 2015 (ES6) included. Let is not supportive for old browsers but it can easily handle new browsers. Let is block scoped but not function scoped also it can be hoisted as like var. As var has some issue while handling erros, let came as a blessing to overcome those errors and handled them smoothly.
   <br>
  <h3>const:</h3>  Const was first introduced in 2015 (ES6) included. Const is like constant means its value cant be changable so if its once intialized then done it cant be reintialized in the same scope like let.

<h1>2) What is the difference between map(), forEach(), and filter()?</h1>
<h3>map()</h3>
Use map when want to transform each item in an array and get a new array.
It doesn’t change the original array; it creates a new one.
<br>
<h3>forEach()</h3>
Use forEach when just want to do something with each item, like print it or add to a total.
It doesn’t return a new array.
<br>
<h3>filter()</h3>
Use filter when want to keep only some items from an array based on a condition.
It returns a new array with only the items that pass the test.
